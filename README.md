# Microplastics-Analysis
Analysis of occurrence of Microplastics in food and possible correlation with economic factors such as GDP and greenhouse gas emissions. Is Microplastic contamination an inevitable side effect of human development? If true, how to revert this trend? 
PROBLEM
Microplastic contamination in food is a growing concern, with microplastics found in various food items, including seafood, meat, plant-based proteins, and even everyday staples like salt and sugar. This contamination originates from various sources, including polluted water and soil, food processing, and food packaging. While the extent of health risks associated with microplastic consumption is still under investigation, potential impacts include inflammation, immune system disruption, and potential interference with hormone regulation.
